In the\\r\\nanalysis it is a powder, the alchemical powder of projection ;\\r\\nhefore the analysis and in the synthesis it is a stone. The\\r\\nphilosophical stone, say the masters, must not be exposed to\\r\\nthe air, nor to the eyes of the profane ; it must be kept in\\r\\n-  goncealinent and preserved carefully in the most secret recep-\\r\\ntacle of the laboratory, the key of the place being always\\r\\n; carried upon the person,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x91He who possesses the great areanum is traly king and is\\r\\nabove any king, for he is inaccessible to alt fears and to all\\r\\nvain hopes. In any malady of soul or body, a single frag-\\r\\nment broken from the precious stone, a single grain of the\\r\\ndivine powder, are more than sufficient for their eure. \\x93He\\r\\nthat hath ears to hear, let him hear,\\x94 as the Master said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalt, sulphur, and the mercuries are only accessory\\r\\nelements and pussive instruments of the great enterprise,\\r\\nEverything depends, as we have said, upon the interior\\r\\nmagnes of Paracelsus. The work consists entirely in pro-\\r\\njection, and projection is accomplished perfectly by the\\r\\neffective and realisable intelligence of a single word. There\\r\\nis but one important operation, and that is sublimation,\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n'",

The first is Ludwig\\r\\nBolzmann (1804-1906) whose special field of research was\\r\\nsteam technology, the efficiency of which he wanted to\\r\\nimprove. To reach the pressures and the high temperatures\\r\\nthat this technology demanded, Bolzmann found that the\\r\\nsteam's or gas's molecules must be made to move in a straight\\r\\nline for high efficiency. At the same time he made the\\r\\ndisappointing discovery that it was virtually impossible to\\r\\ncreate this straight-line movement, even with two-atom gases,\\r\\nsuch as hydrogen. When the two-atom gas was exposed to a\\r\\nmoving impulse, it wanted to begin to spin, whereby its own\\r\\nrotation \\x91ate up' a large part of the energy created, leaving only\\r\\na small amount to remain. It was even worse with multiple-\\r\\natom gases, such as water steam, where a \\x91straight motion\\x92 was\\r\\neven more difficult to achieve. Bolzmann was very disap-\\r\\npointed by these findings, for he thought the study of heat and\\r\\nheat technology were the most important base for the existing\\r\\ntechnology, and if high efficiency could not be obtained, then\\r\\nit must mean that Nature is mistaken. Low efficiency will cause\\r\\nsuch extensive fuel depletion, that soon we will exhaust the\\r\\nworld\\x92s energy supplies, he thought The situation today\\r\\nshows that Bolzmann's fears were justified.

When technologists now continue to use this\\r\\nincorrect model of motion, they are also responsible for the\\r\\nplundering of earth's oil and coal supplies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other scientist who, without knowing it, confirmed with\\r\\nhis experiments Viktor Schauberger's \\x91spiral motion\\x92 theory\\r\\nwas Felix Ehrenhaft (1879-1952), Professor of Physics at\\r\\nVienna University.

It is also emerging to have application to fundamental\\r\\nphysics. The vortex is a key principle which casts new light on\\r\\nthe findings of physics. The vortex points to a completely new\\r\\nunderstanding of the physical world. At the same time, it\\r\\nopens the door to the super-physical.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo most of us, the physical world seems solid and substantial.\\r\\nYet modern physics has shown quite clearly that this solidity is\\r\\nan illusion. Matter is made up of atoms and these atoms\\r\\nthemselves are mainly empty space, containing sub-atomic\\r\\nparticles such as protons and electrons in constant movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese sub-atomic particles themselves are far from sub-\\r\\nstantial, Ever since Einstein, we have known that matter is\\r\\nequivalent to energy. Particles, in some way, are bundles of\\r\\npure energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this equivalence of matter and energy is a mystery. No\\r\\none understands how particles of matter, seemingly so stable,\\r\\ncan be a form of energy, which is dynamic and ephemeral.\\r\\nModern physics knows that this is so, and exploits this fact,\\r\\nwithout understanding why.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is this central mystery of modern physics that the vortex\\r\\ncan explain, The new idea is that a sub-atomic particle is a\\r\\nvortex of energy. This is a simple principle, but it has immense\\r\\npower. The vortex has the potential to provide an entirely new\\r\\nfoundation for physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vortex begins to explain the properties of particles for\\r\\nthe first time. Particles are a paradox in physics. Sometimes\\r\\nthey behave as little point-like things; sometimes they behave\\r\\nas waves. If particles are really vortices of energy, many of\\r\\nthese paradoxes can be resolved. The complexity of physics\\r\\nmelts away.\\r\\n\"",

It can even\\r\\nact \\x91at a distance\\x92 - across apparendy empty space. We are all\\r\\nfamiliar with the way two magnets bounce off each other- or\\r\\nattract - without touching. If particles are pictured as inert\\r\\n\\x91plobs\\' of material, these effects are very hard to explain. But if\\r\\nparticles of matter are really extended vortices, it becomes\\r\\nvery easy to see how they can interact with each other to create\\r\\nsuch effects as electric charge and magnetism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vortex, as it is developed, shows that even apparendy\\r\\nempty space is full of energy. It makes clear how this energy\\r\\nrelates to matter, and how \\x91subtle\\x92 energies interact with the\\r\\nphysical world.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the extraordinary effects mat Schauberger produced\\r\\nmay be explicable in terms of a resonance effect between these\\r\\nsubde energies and the energy in matter.

Within this phenomenon\\r\\nhe saw evidence for his theory that the trout exploited some\\r\\nhitherto unknown source of energy within the water. He can\\r\\nhimself describe such an observation;\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was spawning time one early spring moonlight night I\\r\\nwas sitting beside a waterfall waiting to catch a dangerous\\r\\nfish poacher. What then occurred took place so quickly that\\r\\nI was hardly able to comprehend. In the moonlight falling\\r\\ndirectly onto the crystal clear water, every movement of the\\r\\nfish, garnered in large numbers, could be observed. Suddenly\\r\\nthe trout dispersed, due to the appearance of a particularly\\r\\nlarge fish which swam up from below to confront the\\r\\nwaterfall. It seemed as if it wished to disturb me other trout\\r\\nand danced in great twisting movements in the undulating\\r\\nwater, as it swam quickly to and fro. Then, as suddenly, the\\r\\nlarge trout disappeared in the jet of the waterfall which\\r\\nglistened like falling metal. I saw it fleetingly under a\\r\\nconically-shaped stream of water, dancing in a wild spinning\\r\\nmovement the reason for which was at first not clear to me.\\r\\nIt then came out of this spinning movement and floated\\r\\nmotionlessly upwards. On reaching the lower curve of the\\r\\nwaterfall, it tumbled over and with a strong push reached\\r\\nbehind the upper curve of the waterfall. There, in the fast-\\r\\nflowing water, with a vigorous tail movement it disappeared.\\r\\nDeep in thought I filled my pipe, and as I wended my way\\r\\nhomewards, smoked it to the end. I often subsequendy saw\\r\\nthe same sequence of play of a trout jumping a high\\r\\nwaterfall. After decades of similar observations, like rows of\\r\\npearls on a chain, I should be able to come to some\\r\\nconclusion. But no scientist has been able to explain this\\r\\nphenomenon to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchauberger, in another connection, suggests that a natural\\r\\nwatercourse allowing natural motion, builds up an energy\\r\\nthat flows in the opposite direction to the water, It is this\\r\\nenergy that is used by the trout. In a suitably formed waterfall\\r\\nthis energy flow can be distinguished as a channel of light\\r\\nwithin the streaming water. The trout seeks out this energy\\r\\nflow, and is sucked upwards as if in a whirlwind,\\r\\n\"",

At the same time surrounding salts are dissolved and\\r\\ncarried away with the gas to be deposited again in layers near\\r\\nthe surface, which is kept cool by the \\x91refrigeration\\x92 effect of\\r\\nthe vegetation, This is how a constant supply of nutrition is\\r\\nmade available for vegetation, and deposited at root level.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the half cycle, on the other hand, no such nutritional flow\\r\\noccurs. If the surface area has little or no vegetation cover, as\\r\\nfor example after timber cutting, it becomes warmed up by the\\r\\nsun. If the ground is warmer than the precipitation the\\r\\nmoisture is prevented from penetrating the soil.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the water sinks just below the surface, it rapidly warms\\r\\nup and runs off, without having been able to bring up any of\\r\\nthe nutritional salts. It alse evaporates much more quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cycle also governs the formation of subsoil water, and\\r\\nits relative level. Where only half that cycle is completed there\\r\\nis no subsoil water, or rather, it is at great depth, having been\\r\\ndependent on the vegetation\\x92s cooling action of the soil. If, for\\r\\nexample, there was a dry period in a normal landscape, the\\r\\nevaporation rates of the trees would increase, meaning that\\r\\nwarmth was taken away from the root areas, which cool down\\r\\ntowards +4\\xb0C.

This has the effect of reducing the supply of deep\\r\\nground water and its accompanying nutrients, The timber\\r\\nneeds of our modern construction industry has led to the\\r\\nclear felling forestry economy with its forced replanting\\r\\nmethods, resulting in a general decline in the quality of the\\r\\ntimber.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disturbance of the forest's natural balance has also far\\r\\nreaching consequences as the whole nutritional supply for the\\r\\nsurrounding landscape is seriously damaged.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the wholesale clearance of forest areas and the\\r\\ndying out of certain types of wood, the soil starts to lose\\r\\nnutrients, The sun's rays are now able to reach the soil\\r\\nsurface, causing it to warm up. This means that the ground\\r\\nwater containing the essential nutrients is prevented from\\r\\nrising, and the vital salts are deposited below the root level\\r\\nof the saplings. The roots can no longer reach the nutritive\\r\\nlayer deep in the soil. Soon the vegetation will diminish and\\r\\nthe decline to desert waste begins.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchauberger points out that a natural forest has an average\\r\\ntemperature in the root zone of +9\\xb0C.

Walter Schauberger\\r\\nhas said that water disappears from fields that have been\\r\\nploughed in this way, for straightforward physical reasons; the\\r\\niron plough's rapid passage through the soil cuts through the\\r\\nfields magnetic lines of energy, causing an electrical current to\\r\\noccur in the same way that a coil in an electric generator rotates\\r\\nin a magnetic field.

His attention focused on copper. Copper-\\r\\nrich soils retained their ground moisture well, and so he began\\r\\nto experiment with copper ploughs as well as other equipment\\r\\nmade from copper. To begin with he merely covered an iron\\r\\nplough's cutting surface with copper sheeting and made tests\\r\\nwith this. The tests took place under controlled conditions,\\r\\ndividing the field up into segments, some of which were\\r\\nploughed with the prevailing iron machinery and some with\\r\\nthe adapted copper machinery. The results proved very\\r\\nfavourable to the copper, which showed a 17-35 per cent\\r\\nincrease in harvest. A large firm, Farmleiten - Gut Heuberg,\\r\\nnear Salzburg, showed an increase of 50 per cent Ona hill\\r\\n\"",

During 1951-52 controlled tests with the copper\\r\\nplough were made by the Farming Chemical Test Station in\\r\\nLinz, The tests concerned the cultivation of oats, wheat, kohl-\\r\\nrabbi and onions, Certain sections were worked only with iron\\r\\nmachinery, others with iron machinery and added copper\\r\\nsulphate, and a third area with only copper machinery.

The latter arrived in an\\r\\nelegant car, and the following ensued: the treasury director:\\r\\n\\x91There has been a rumour that the Salzburg town corporation\\r\\nhas carried out successful tests with your ploughs, and,\\r\\nnaturally, this is of interest But now I must ask you face to face\\r\\n- what is is worth to me, if I support you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSchauberger said: T don\\'t understand what you mean. You\\r\\nare from the treasury, you have nothing to do with support I\\r\\nhave paid my fees for the test and everything is complete.\\x92\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Treasury director went on: T must make myself clear.\\r\\nThe fact is, I have an agreement with the nitrogen industry\\r\\nwhereby if I can stimulate the farmers to use more nitrogen\\r\\nthan usual I receive a royalty for each sack being sold. If now\\r\\nthe farmers were to change to the copper plough the demand\\r\\nwould permanently diminish, and thus I need royalties from\\r\\nyour ploughs as compensation. Can\\'t we come to an under-\\r\\nstanding as old friends and make a good deal for us both?\\x92\\r\\nSchauberger replied furiously: \\'l have only one thing to say\\r\\n'",

Its\\r\\nprinciple of turning the soil was much the same as that used by\\r\\nthe burrowing mole.

He saw the plant as the end product of energies\\r\\nmeeting each other above the insulation layer at surface level.\\r\\nThus all his attempts to encourage growth were devoted to\\r\\nincreasing the soil's energy, and to encouraging the build-up\\r\\nand preservation of the insulation \\x91skin\\x92. He rejected all\\r\\nactivity that removed energy from the ground and damaged\\r\\nthe insulation, Consequently he was, for example, a vigorous\\r\\nopponent of Thomas-phosphate,\\x94 a product of the blast\\r\\nfurnace which drains the soil of strength. When it is introduced\\r\\nto the soil it tied to compensate for this by attracting new energy.\\r\\nOne way to build up the ground energy is by adding stable\\r\\nManure, compost, micro-nutritional elements, and catalysts\\r\\nto the soil, which should in turn be well covered and protected\\r\\nfrom the direct rays of the sun. Also, iron tools are to be\\r\\navoided. It is of course important that the whole landscape is\\r\\nhealthy, with forests and water living natural lives, as it is from\\r\\nthese sources that the ground energy originates. Schauberger\\r\\nstressed, on the other hand, that the ground's energy could be\\r\\nincreased by using \\x91biological\\x92 machinery.
